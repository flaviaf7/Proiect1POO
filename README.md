## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This application was made as a project for the Object Oriented Programming Class I took in my First Year of being a Student at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest.
The purpose of this project is to create a console-based application that allows customers to place orders from a menu of products,
and for employees to check their data. The application has three main user interfaces:
one for customers to browse and order products, one for employees to check their data,
and one for administrators to manage employees, products and ingredients. The customer interface allows users to browse a list of available products,
add products to their order, remove products from their order and place the order when they are finished. The employee interface allows users to view their data.
The administrator interface allows users to manage the list of employees, products and ingredients, add new employees, products or ingredients,
modify existing ones, or remove them entirely. Overall, the application provides a simple,
yet efficient way for customers, employees, and administrators to interact with the product ordering system.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You don't need to install anything for the code to work. To run this program, users must have a C++ compiler installed on their system and clone the repository:

1. First, navigate to the directory that you would like to clone the repository into using commands like: 
```cd```: to change your working directory.
```cd../``` to "go back" a level in your directory tree.
2. Next, clone the remote repository and create a local copy on your machine using this command:
```git clone https://github.com/flaviaf7/ProiectPOO```
3. Now you can see the contents of the remote repository on your machine by moving the newly cloned directory:
```
cd ProiectPOO/
ls -la
```


## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
 
1. Upon running the program, the user will be prompted to select from the main menu options.
2. If the user selects the "client" option, they will be presented with the menu for food items. The user can select a food item, and it will be added to their order.
The user can also remove a food item from their order or finalize their order.
3. If the user selects the "employee" option, they will be prompted to enter an employee ID. Once entered, the program will display the details of the employee.
4. If the user selects the "administrator" option, they will be presented with the menu for administrator options. From there, the user can add, remove or modify employees.


Limitations:

   1. This program does not provide any functionality for payment.
   2. This program does not support multiple users.
   3. This program does not provide any authentication or security measures.
